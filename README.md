# Project Status

## Repository Access

**Note**: This repository is currently private as our smart contracts are pending security audit. We are committed to open-sourcing the codebase once the audit process is complete.

For evaluation purposes, we are providing access to the **Stellar Build Main Committee** upon request. Please reach out to our team for private repository access.

## Live Deployments

### Production MVP
Our minimum viable product is currently live and operational on Kadena EVM:
- **Platform**: [tutum.so](https://tutum.so)

### Test Deployment
A test version of the Tutum contract is deployed on Stellar Mainnet for evaluation and testing:
- **Contract Address**: `CAUSE4KH5IDFLOJRZXICMYB22H5IG6CT37QGF2DUOYGUMAVJ4IJ5ZSDH`
- **Explorer Link**: [View on Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/contract/CAUSE4KH5IDFLOJRZXICMYB22H5IG6CT37QGF2DUOYGUMAVJ4IJ5ZSDH)

## Security & Transparency

We prioritize security and transparency in our development process. The decision to keep the repository private during the audit phase ensures that any potential vulnerabilities are addressed before public release.

**Timeline**: Open-source release planned upon successful completion of security audit.
